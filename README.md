# Flashcards
Flashcards app for learning Swedish

A user can study new words represented as cards grouped by decks using spaced repetition method.

- user selects deck to study
- user sets the number of words to learn by day (target)
- n cards will be taken from the deck and shown to the user
- after the first review, user will put each of the reviewed cards in one of 3 boxes (box for easy-to-recall words, medium or hard)
- on each session, n number of cards would be shown to the user for review, words to review are selected based on which box they are
(frecuency on which words are reviewed depends on which box it was placed on, so that words on hard-to-recall box are reviewed more frecuently than words in easy-to-recall box)
