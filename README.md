Flashcards app for learning Swedish

Study new words using spaced repetition method.

- Words and phrases are represented as cards grouped in decks.
- Set a target number of words you wish to review by day.
- Move the cards between boxes depending on how well you remember the information.
- Frequency on which words are reviewed depends on which box it was placed in, so that words on hard-to-recall box are reviewed more frequently than words in easy-to-recall box.
